# OpenWindow Samples

There are currently 4 simple samples. The OpenGL and DirectX sample are mostly there so I could check everything was working properly. They do not show off the OpenWindow API.
The HelloOpenWindow sample is about the smallest project you can write with OpenWindow. It implements an event loop and responds to some user input to modify the window using the OpenWindow API.
The Veldrid sample show how to create a graphics device for Veldrid from a window created by OpenWindow.

## Running the samples

The easiest way to run these samples is using dotnet CLI.
If you have it installed, you can just navigate to one of
the sample directories and run `dotnet run`.
