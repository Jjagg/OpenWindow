# Hello OpenWindow

This sample creates a window, supports some key input to manipulate it and prints events to console.

If you see some weird artifacts in the window (including an old school border),
that's because nothing is drawn to it.

Inputs:

- **b**: Toggle border
- **r**: Toggle resizable
- **m**: Move the window to a random position with a random size
- **p**: Print some information about the window to console.
- **Esc**: Close the window
