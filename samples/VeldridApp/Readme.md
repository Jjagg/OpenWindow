# Veldrid

This sample initializes a Veldrid GraphicsDevice and renders to a window created by OpenWindow.
The code apart from the initialization is copied from the Veldrid Getting Started sample: https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid-samples/blob/master/src/GettingStarted/Program.cs

At the top of Program.cs you can change the graphics backend that is used. The currently implemented OS + graphics backend combinations are the following:

- Windows
  - Direct3D 11
  - Vulkan
