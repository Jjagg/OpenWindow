## OpenWindow.GL

This library can be used with OpenWindow to use OpenGL with an OpenWindow window in a cross-platform way.

OpenGL set up is complicated and different depending on what windowing backend is used.
To make things easier for users this library unifies OpenGL set up.
See the [OpenGL sample](../samples/OpenGL) for a usage example.
